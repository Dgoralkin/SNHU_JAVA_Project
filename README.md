Overview:
Currently when Grazioso Salvare acquires a dog, they record the name, breed, gender, age, and weight.
Grazioso Salvare also records the date and the location where they acquired the dog.
Additionally, they track the training status of the dog, as described above.
When a dog is “in-service,” they record the country where the dog is in service and whether or not the dog is “reserved.”
As Grazioso Salvare explores the use of monkeys as search and rescue animals, they want their system to support monkey tracking and dog tracking.
They have identified the following monkey species that are eligible for training: Capuchin, Guenon, Macaque, Marmoset, Squirrel monkey, and Tamarin.
Grazioso Salvare currently uses dogs as search and rescue animals.
They expect to begin training monkeys as search and rescue animals as well.
In current operations, dogs are given the status of “intake” before training starts.
Once in training, their status can change to one of five phases: Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, Phase IV, and Phase V.
When a dog graduates from training, it is given the status of “in-service” and is considered a Rescue Animal.
If a dog does not successfully make it through training, it is given the status of “farm,” indicating that it will live a life of leisure on a Grazioso Salvare farm.
The app follows the OOP principles and extends the dog base class.
The app allows the user to input, search, and reserve desired animals from the animal database.
The app also lists all the available animals with their details.
